    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <h3>What is the Cat Cannabis Café?</h3>
    <p>The Cat Cannabis Café is a unique business combining the relaxing environment of a cat café with the therapeutic benefits of cannabis products. Guests can enjoy cuddles with our resident cats while sampling carefully curated cannabis offerings for humans — plus pet-friendly products for their furry companions!</p>

    <h3>Why mix cats and cannabis?</h3>
    <p>In today’s fast-paced world, people seek wellness, stress relief, and unique social experiences. Combining a cat café with cannabis creates a cozy space where visitors can relax, connect, and find companionship — while benefiting from calming cannabis products.</p>

    <h3>Is it safe for pets?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely. All pet cannabis products are specially formulated and responsibly sourced. Safety is our top priority: products are tested, properly labeled, and tailored for animals’ unique needs.</p>

    <h3>How do you ensure legal compliance?</h3>
    <p>We keep an attorney on payroll to provide ongoing legal guidance. This ensures we follow all state and federal regulations, including licensing, product testing, labeling standards, security, and advertising rules.</p>

    <h3>What makes your café different from competitors?</h3>
    <p>Besides the unique concept itself, we offer a dedicated line of pet-focused cannabis products, partner with local animal rescues, and create a welcoming community space. We also invest in employee training to deliver exceptional service.</p>

    <h3>Do you sell cannabis to everyone?</h3>
    <p>No — all cannabis sales follow strict age verification and legal purchase limits. Human cannabis products are for adults 21+ with valid ID.</p>

    <h3>How do you protect customer data?</h3>
    <p>We use strong cybersecurity measures, modern e-commerce platforms, and a secure CRM system to protect customer information and sales records.</p>

    <h3>What technologies do you use to run the café?</h3>
    <p>Our café uses e-commerce for online orders, online booking systems for reservations, and CRM software to track customer interactions — all supported by cybersecurity tools to keep everything secure.</p>

    <h3>Are your cannabis products ethically sourced?</h3>
    <p>Yes. We are committed to responsible sourcing and transparency. Our products are tested for safety, and we only partner with reputable suppliers who share our ethical standards.</p>

    <h3>Do you support local rescues?</h3>
